# Code Review Report:

## Overview:

In this code review, I reviewed an implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for a graph-based problem. The
code snippet was analyzed for issues, bugs, inefficiencies, and code quality, readability, and organization. I have
provided specific suggestions for improvements and optimizations, along with revised code snippets where necessary.

### Findings:

1. There is no check for the start and end nodes being present in the graph. If either start or end node is not present
   in the graph, the function will not provide the correct output. It is important to handle such scenarios and raise an
   exception or return an appropriate value to indicate that the start or end node is not present in the graph.


2. The function returns -1 if there is no path between the start and end nodes. Instead of returning -1, it would be
   better to raise an exception or return a specific value to indicate that there is no path between the start and end
   nodes.


3. The variable names used in the function are not descriptive enough. It would be better to use more descriptive names
   such as "frontier" instead of "heap" and "visited_nodes" instead of "visited" to make the code more readable and
   self-explanatory.


4. The code is not properly formatted, which can make it difficult to read and understand. It is important to follow PEP
   8 guidelines for Python code formatting.


5. The graph is hardcoded into the code, which can make it difficult to reuse the function for other graphs. It would be
   better to pass the graph as an argument to the function.


6. The function does not handle negative edge weights. Dijkstra's algorithm assumes that all edge weights are
   non-negative. If negative edge weights are present, the algorithm may not provide the correct shortest path.

Suggestions for Improvements and Optimizations:

1. Check if the start and end nodes are present in the graph and raise an exception if they are not present. This can be
   done using the "in" operator to check if the nodes are present in the graph.

Revised code snippet:

```python
import heapq


def shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    if start not in graph or end not in graph:
        raise ValueError("Start or end node not in graph")
    heap = [(0, start)]
    visited_nodes = set()
    while heap:
        (cost, current) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if current in visited_nodes:
            continue
        visited_nodes.add(current)
        if current == end:
            return cost
        for neighbor, edge_cost in graph[current]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (cost + edge_cost, neighbor))
    raise ValueError("No path exists between start and end nodes")
```

2. Return a specific value or raise an exception to indicate that there is no path between the start and end nodes. This
   can be done using the "raise" statement to raise a custom exception when no path is found or by returning a specific
   value like "None".

Revised code snippet:

```python
import heapq


def shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    if start not in graph or end not in graph:
        raise ValueError("Start or end node not in graph")
    heap = [(0, start)]
    visited_nodes = set()
    while heap:
        (cost, current) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if current in visited_nodes:
            continue
        visited_nodes.add(current)
        if current == end:
            return cost
        for neighbor, edge_cost in graph[current]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (cost + edge_cost, neighbor))
    raise ValueError("No path exists between start and end nodes")
```

3. Use more descriptive variable names to make the code more readable. For example, use "frontier" instead
